# ClusteringGeoLocation
Clustering Geolocation Data Intelligently in Python<br/>
Project Structure<br/>
The hands on project on Clustering Geolocation Data is divided into following tasks:<br/>

Task 1: An introduction to the problem, as well as basic exploratory data analysis and visualizations<br/>
Task 2: Visualizing geographical data in a more meaningful and interactive way<br/>
Task 3: Methods of evaluating the strength of a clustering algorithm<br/>
Task 4: Theory behind K-Means, and how to use it for our problem<br/>
Task 5: Introduction to density-based clustering approaches, and how to use DBSCAN<br/>
Task 6: Introduction to HDBSCAN, to alleviate constraints of classical DBSCAN<br/>
Task 7: A simple method to address outliers classified by density-based models<br/>
